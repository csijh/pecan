Input is a pointer.  To utf8 char, or to token. Ops are:
    look(p)     // get unicode value or tag number.  Tag == 0 for end sentinel.
    q = next(p) // move forward.
    backtrack(p)
    provider can change token tags as a side effect

In the parser, build is done symbolically for lookahead, so calls happen once.

Approach is to translate:
    @3fun -> act3(fun, x, y, z)
    @*fun -> act(fun, 3, [x,y,z])
    auto "+" -> PL (or define in grammar somehow)
Moderately generic. Switch needed to convert to fun(x,y,z), but that
    switch is needed somewhere.
    (still need to map symbols to integers, maybe defined in header?)

Distinguish between 'leaf' (takes range of characters or previous token) and
varargs call with 0 children (takes empty range) ?

Notation { ... ^ ... } @*fun for varargs

Do something special about start and end of construct for range marking.
Could use notation:
    { begin ... *arg ... end } @3construct
    means remember positions, call 'range(begin end)' if not default.

Note { at start of left hand alternative needs special treatment.
Could { ... } @*fun also be needed for range adjustment?
Could notation be used instead of @ for discarding?

Have another think about frame sizes - are they worth it?  Maybe inlined
functions with fast routes are enough.

Improvement in parse args
=========================

Don't start with STOP. Have it at end or somewhere.
Don't need act - have a header include (or signatures).
Don't need cs (just let other module do it).
That leaves:
    parse(byte *code, item *in, state *out);
