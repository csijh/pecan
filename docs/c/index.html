<h1>A parser for C</h1>

<p>The development of a scanner and parser for C presented here is based on the
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2310.pdf">C18
standard</a>. It demonstrates the use of Pecan and, in particular, the use of
manual grammar transformation as a way of developing parsers.</p>

<p>The result is simply a literal translation of the official C18 grammar into
the Pecan notation.  It does not take into account common extensions or other
variations to the C18 language such as implementation-defined aspects.
Nor does it attempt to deal with the preprocessing phase or other practical
issues that arise in real C compilers. It is not intended to be a compiler-grade
parser, merely a reinterpretation of the official grammar.</p>

<p>Infamously, parsing of C requires type names introduced using
<code>typedef</code> to be differentiated from other identifiers. This means
that parsing cannot be entirely context-free. To deal with this, the grammar is
separated into a scanner and a parser, and it is assumed that the external code
associated with the parser includes some form of symbol table construction, and
uses the information to provide suitable token tags during parsing.</p>

<p>The development described here amounts to translating the C18 syntax into a
nearly-recursive-descent form, which has been done before in various compilers.
The difference here is that a potentially reusable grammar has been produced
rather than a one-off parser for a specific purpose.</p>
