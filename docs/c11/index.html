<h1>A parser for C</h1>

<p>The development of a scanner and parser for C presented here is based on
the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf">C11
standard</a>. It demonstrates the use of Pecan and, in particular, the use of
manual grammar transformation as a way of developing parsers.</p>

<p>The result is simply a literal translation of the official C11 grammar into
the Pecan notation.  It does not take into account common extensions or other
variations to the C11 language, or differing interpretations of the standard.
Nor does it attempt to deal with the preprocessing phase or other practical
issues that arise in real C compilers. It is not intended to be a compiler-grade
parser, merely a reinterpretation of the official grammar, and it has also only
been lightly tested.</p>

<p>Infamously, parsing of C requires type names introduced using
<code>typedef</code> to be differentiated from other identifiers.  This cannot
be done during scanning.  Instead, token tags must be altered during parsing,
which must include some form of symbol table construction. It is assumed that
the external code associated with the parser when the grammar is compiled will
do this.</p>

<p>The development described here amounts to translating the C11 syntax into a
nearly-recursive-descent form, which has been done before in various compilers.
The difference is that a potentially reusable grammar has been produced rather
than a one-off parser for a specific purpose.</p>
