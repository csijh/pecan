<h1>The C parser</h1>

<p>The parser is defined separately, with tokens from the scanner as its input.
The rules are presented in stages, in the order given in appendix A of the C11
standard.</p>

<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>A separate file is used to define and test C expressions, separately from the
remainder of the grammar:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c-expressions.txt">c-expressions.txt</a></p>

<p>The grammar begins with:</p>

<pre class="pecan">start = expression
type-name = %TypeName @typeName
initializer-list = %InitializerList @initializerList
</pre>

<p>The <code class="pecan">start</code> rule allows the definitions to be
presented in the order of the standard, with the <code
class="pecan">expression</code> rule at the end. The other two rules temporarily
cover forward references from the expression section of the standard to a later
section, by defining them as if they were tokens.</p>

<p>The input to the parser is an array of tokens produced by the scanner. The
tag of a token is defined by the action used in the scanner to create it. It is
assumed, however, that a tag <code class="pecan">%Identifier</code> is changed
to <code class="pecan">%TypedefName</code> where appropriate by the parser's
external code, in response to actions taken when parsing typedefs. In addition,
since enumeration constants are not distinguished from identifiers in the
scanner, this definition is included from the lexical grammar:</p>

<pre class="pecan">enumeration-constant = identifier
</pre>

<p>Definitions are also introduced to recognize individual tokens, and establish
error markers. These are intended to make the rest of the grammar more readable
by making it more closely resemble the original C11 grammar. First there are
definitions which deal with types of token with variable spellings:</p>

<pre class="pecan">identifier = #atom %Identifier @identifier
constant = #atom %Constant @constant
string-literal = #atom %StringLiteral @StringLiteral
typedef-name = #atom %TypedefName @TypedefName
</pre>

<p>The <code class="pecan">identifier</code> rule, for example, sets up an error
marker, matches a token with tag <code class="pecan">%Identifier</code> and
converts it into an output item. There is a group of rules for keywords:</p>

<pre class="pecan">`alignof` = %Alignof
`auto` = #type %Auto
...
`_Thread_local` = %ThreadLocal
</pre>

<p>These use backquote identifiers using the original spellings for the
keywords. Keywords which have to do with types system are marked with the <code
class="pecan">#type</code> marker. Also, keywords which continue a construct
rather than start a new one are given error markers. There is a group of
definitions for punctuators:</p>

<pre class="pecan">`%:%:` = #op %PercentColonPercentColon
`<<=` = #op %LessLessEquals
...
`#` = #hash %Hash
</pre>

<p>Again, these use the original spelling in backquotes, to match the original
grammar closely, and error markers are included.</p>

<p>Precedence and associativity are dealt with in the original grammar by
defining hierarchically layered rules for expressions. The transformation into
Pecan follows the same style, and is reasonably straightforward. The original
rule for primary expressions is:</p>

<pre class="c11">primary-expression =
    identifier |
    constant |
    string-literal |
    '(' expression ')' |
    generic-selection
</pre>

<p>There are no translation problems, since each alternative starts with a
different type of token:</p>

<pre class="pecan">primary-expression =
    identifier /
    constant /
    string-literal /
    `(`expression `)` /
    generic-selection
</pre>

<p>Generic selections are new in C11, but also cause no translation
problems:</p>

<pre class="pecan">generic-selection =
    `_Generic` `(` assignment-expression `,` generic-assoc-list `)` @2generic

generic-assoc-list = generic-association (generic-association @2pair)*

generic-association =
    type-name `:` assignment-expression @2assoc /
    `default` `:` assignment-expression @1defaultAssoc
</pre>

<p>The <code class="pecan">@2pair</code> action is a general purpose one for
building lists.</p>

<p>The original rule for postfix expressions is:</p>

<pre class="c11">postfix-expression =
    primary-expression |
    postfix-expression '[' expression ']' |
    postfix-expression '(' argument-expression-list? ')' |
    postfix-expression '.' identifier |
    postfix-expression '->' identifier |
    postfix-expression '++' |
    postfix-expression '--' |
    '(' type-name ')' '{' initializer-list '}' |
    '(' type-name ')' '{' initializer-list ',' '}'
</pre>

<p>There is a problem here because the first alternative can be a bracketed
expression which begins with <code>'('</code>, and the last two alternatives
also begin with <code>'('</code>. An expression and a type name begin with
different tokens but, when bracketed, they require a two-token lookahead to
distinguish them.</p>

<p>In addition, the last two alternatives, which describe compound literals,
will cause an overlap later in the grammar with cast expressions, which also
begin with a bracketed type name.</p>

<p>Rather than stray too far from the structure of the original rules, a try
expression is used to check for the open curly bracket:</p>

<pre class="pecan">[`(` type-name `)` `{`]
</pre>

<p>Now the left recursion can be removed from the postfix expression rule, and
the last two alternatives can be merged and put at the beginning:</p>

<pre class="pecan">postfix-expression =
    [`(` type-name `)` `{`] initializer-list `,`? `}` @2compound /
    primary-expression (
        `[` expression `]` @2index /
        `(` (argument-expression-list / "" @missing) `)` @2apply /
        `.` identifier @2field /
        `->` identifier @2arrow /
        `++` @1postInc /
        `--` @1postDec
    )*
</pre>

<p>The rule for an initializer list will later need to be defined to exclude the
optional final comma shown here.</p>

<p>The next layer up in the expression hierarchy is unary expressions, with
original rule:</p>

<pre class="c11">unary-expression  =
    postfix-expression |
    '++' unary-expression |
    '--' unary-expression |
    unary-operator cast-expression |
    'sizeof' unary-expression |
    'sizeof' '(' type-name ')' |
    'alignof' '(' type-name ')'
</pre>

<p>The two alternatives starting with <code class="c11">sizeof</code> overlap,
because a <code class="c11">unary-expression</code> can be bracketed. To resolve
this, the two alternatives can be reversed and a try expression applied:</p>

<pre class="pecan">unary-expression  =
    postfix-expression /
    `++` unary-expression @1preInc /
    `--` unary-expression @1preDec /
    unary-operator cast-expression @2preOp /
    [`sizeof` `(` type-name `)`] @1typeSize /
    `sizeof` unary-expression @1varSize /
    `alignof` `(` type-name `)` @1align
</pre>

<p>The next layer up is cast expressions, with original rule:</p>

<pre class="c11">cast-expression =
    unary-expression |
    "(" type-name ")" cast-expression
</pre>

<p>The first alternative overlaps with the second, because it can start with a
bracket. And the second alternative overlaps with compound literals. The
alternatives can be swapped, and a lookahead used to check for a type-name but
no curly bracket:</p>

<pre class="pecan">cast-expression =
    [`(` type-name `)` `{`!] cast-expression @2cast /
    unary-expression
</pre>

<p>The next level up in the expression hierarchy is multiplicative
expressions, defined by the original rule:</p>

<pre class="c11">multiplicative-expression =
    cast-expression |
    multiplicative-expression "*" cast-expression |
    multiplicative-expression "/" cast-expression |
    multiplicative-expression "%" cast-expression
</pre>

<p>This can be transformed in a straightforward way to:</p>

<pre class="pecan">multiplicative-expression =
    cast-expression (
        `*` cast-expression @2multiply /
        `/` cast-expression @2divide /
        `%` cast-expression @2remainder
    )*

</pre>

<p>The same approach can be taken to additive expressions, shift expressions,
relational expressions, equality expressions, AND expressions, exclusive OR
expressions, inclusive OR expressions, logical AND expressions, and logical OR
expressions. These all define the precedences of infix operators in the same
way.</p>

<p>The original rule for conditional expressions is:</p>

<pre class="c11">conditional-expression =
    logical-OR-expression |
    logical-OR-expression "?" expression ":" conditional-expression
</pre>

<p>This defines the ternary operator. It easy to handle by combining the
prefixes and making the suffix optional:</p>

<pre class="pecan">conditional-expression =
    logical-OR-expression (`?` expression `:` conditional-expression @3ifExp)?
</pre>

<p>The original rule for assignment expressions is:</p>

<pre class="c11">assignment-expression =
    conditional-expression |
    unary-expression assignment-operator assignment-expression
</pre>

<p>This uses right recursion rather than left recursion, to capture the right
associativity of the assignment operators. The right recursion can remain in the
translation. However, there is a problematic overlap between the two
alternatives. Perhaps the simplest approach is to swap the alternatives and use
lookahead to match the assignment operator before accepting the new first
alternative:</p>

<pre class="pecan">assignment-expression =
    [unary-expression assignment-operator] assignment-expression @3assign /
    conditional-expression
</pre>

<p>At the top of the expression hierarchy is the expression rule:</p>

<pre class="c11">expression =
    assignment-expression |
    expression "," assignment-expression
</pre>

<p>This poses no problems, beyond the usual removal of left recursion:</p>

<pre class="pecan">expression =
    assignment-expression (`,` assignment-expression @2comma)*
</pre>

<p>The expression section of the C11 grammar has one more rule in it. It is
just a synonym which makes some of the later rules more readable. There is no
harm in including it in the Pecan translation:</p>

<pre class="pecan">constant-expression =
    conditional-expression
</pre>

<h2>Declarations</h2>

<p>Here is a file which adds declaration rules to the expression rules developed
so far, and which provides tests for these new rules:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c-declarations.txt">c-declarations.txt</a></p>

declaration =
    static_assert-declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (init-declarator-list @2declare)? `;`

<hr/>


<p>A second prototype of the grammar, demonstrating the full range of
declarations from appendix section A.2.2 of the C11 standard, is:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c-parse-b.txt">c-parse-b.txt</a></p>

<p>Most of the problems faced in parsing declarations are fairly easy. For
example, the original grammar rule from the C11 standard (A.2.2) for a struct or
union specifier is:</p>

<pre class="c11">struct-or-union-specifier =
    struct-or-union identifier? `{` struct-declaration-list `}` |
    struct-or-union identifier
</pre>

<p>Expanding the first alternative, then rearranging to remove the common left
factors gives:</p>

<pre class="pecan">struct-or-union-specifier = struct-or-union (
    identifier (`{` struct-declaration-list `}`)? /
    `{` struct-declaration-list `}`
)
</pre>

<p>The original grammar rules for enumeration specifiers are:</p>

<pre class="c11">enum-specifier =
    `enum` identifier? `{` enumerator-list `}`
    `enum` identifier? `{` enumerator-list `,` `}`
    `enum` identifier

enumerator-list = enumerator (`,` enumerator)*
</pre>

<p>Perhaps the most obvious way to translate the first definition, expanding,
rearranging and combining left factors as before, is:</p>

<pre class="pecan">enum-specifier = `enum` (
    identifier (`{` enumerator-list `,`? `}`)? /
    `{` enumerator-list `,`? `}`
)
</pre>

<p>However, the fact that there is an optional final comma before the close
curly bracket causes a problem. It means that care is needed to prevent it from
being matched in the second rule:</p>

<pre class="pecan">enumerator-list = enumerator ((`,` `}`)! `,` enumerator)*
</pre>

<p>The original rule for <code>direct-declarator</code> is:</p>

<pre class="c11">direct-declarator:
    identifier |
    `(` declarator `)` |
    direct-declarator `[` type-qualifier-list? assignment-expression? `]` |
    direct-declarator `[` `static` type-qualifier-list? assignment-expression `]` |
    direct-declarator `[` type-qualifier-list `static` assignment-expression `]` |
    direct-declarator `[` type-qualifier-list? `*` `]` |
    direct-declarator `(` parameter-type-list `)` |
    direct-declarator `(` identifier-list? `)` |
</pre>

<p>Removing the left recursion, combining the contents of each kind of bracket,
disambiguating alternatives <code>parameter-type-list</code> and
<code>identifier-list</code> by reversing the alternatives and using lookahead
to check for the first identifier, inventing extra rules for clarity, and
tidying up, yields:</p>

<pre class="pecan">direct-declarator =
    (identifier / `(` declarator `)`) dd-bracket*

dd-bracket =
    `(` dd-parameters? `)` / `[` dd-array-size? `]`

dd-parameters =
    identifier&amp; identifier-list / parameter-type-list

dd-array-size =
    `*` /
    `static` type-qualifier-list? assignment-expression /
    type-qualifier-list dd-simple-array-size? /
    assignment-expression

dd-simple-array-size =
    `*` /
    `static` assignment-expression /
    assignment-expression
</pre>

<p>The original rule for <code>direct-abstract-declarator</code> is:</p>

<pre class="c11">direct-abstract-declarator =
    `(` abstract-declarator `)` |
    direct-abstract-declarator? `[` type-qualifier-list? assignment-expression? `]` |
    direct-abstract-declarator? `[` `static` type-qualifier-list? assignment-expression `]` |
    direct-abstract-declarator? `[` type-qualifier-list `static` assignment-expression `]` |
    direct-abstract-declarator? `[` `*` `]` |
    direct-abstract-declarator? `(` parameter-type-list? `)`
</pre>

<p>Going through a similar sequence of small transformations yields:</p>

<pre class="pecan">direct-abstract-declarator =
    `(` abstract-declarator `)` dad-bracket* / dad-bracket+

dad-bracket =
    `(` parameter-type-list? `)` / `[` dad-array-size? `]`

dad-array-size =
    `*` /
    `static` type-qualifier-list? assignment-expression /
    type-qualifier-list dad-simple-array-size? /
    assignment-expression

dad-simple-array-size =
    assignment-expression / `static` assignment-expression
</pre>

<p>The original rule for <code>parameter-declaration</code> is:</p>

<pre class="c11">parameter-declaration =
    declaration-specifiers declarator |
    declaration-specifiers abstract-declarator?
</pre>

<p>Taking out the common left factor, this becomes:</p>

<pre class="c11">parameter-declaration = declaration-specifiers (
    declarator |
    abstract-declarator?
)
</pre>

<p>The approach taken earlier to combine alternatives by transformation to find
their common prefixes doesn't work here, because recursion intervenes before the
issue is resolved. So, it is better to use lookahead. However, it is worth
finding a 'cheap' lookahead. The main difference between the alternatives is
that <code>declarator</code> includes an identifier. Checking the
possibilities, only <code>`*`</code> or <code>type-qualifier</code> or
<code>`(`</code> tokens can occur before the identifier. On the other hand, in
an <code>abstract-declarator</code>, a close bracket must appear before the end.
This leads to:</p>

<pre class="pecan">parameter-declaration = declaration-specifiers (
    has-identifier&amp; declarator /
    abstract-declarator?
)

has-identifier =
    (`*` / type-qualifier / `(`)* `identifier`
</pre>

<p>The transformation of the remainder of the declaration rules is relatively
straightforward.</p>

<hr/>
<p><b>Development incomplete</b></p>
<hr/>

<h2>External definitions</h2>

<p>The remainder of the C11 grammar covering the parser rules will be tackled in
sections. A first prototype of the grammar, just demonstrating the handling of
external definitions in section A.2.4 of the standard, is:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c-parse-a.txt">c-parse-a.txt</a></p>

<p>With a few obvious cosmetic changes to the notation for compatibility with
Pecan, the CFG-based grammar begins with:</p>

<pre class="c11">translation-unit =
    external-declaration | translation-unit external-declaration
</pre>

<p>Removing the left recursion, adding an action to initialize an empty list of
external declarations, and adding end-of-file detection, this can be translated
into:</p>

<pre class="pecan">translation-unit = @0list external-declaration+ ``
</pre>

<p>The original grammar continues with:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration = function-definition | declaration
</pre>

<p>The two alternatives are disjoint, because the grammar is unambiguous, but it
isn't immediately clear how to distinguish them. If it is just assumed that
there is no ambiguous overlap, then there is a direct translation into a Pecan
grammar rule by using lookahead to try one alternative and then the other:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration = [function-definition] / declaration
</pre>

<p>However, since replacing the body of a function definition by a semicolon
yields a declaration, it is clear that the two alternatives share a lot in
common, to the point where it is worth merging them. A fairly straightforward
transformation approach can be used to reach an equivalent form with no
lookahead needed. The relevant rules from the original grammar needed during the
transformation, with left recursion removed, are:</p>

<pre class="c11">function-definition =
    declaration-specifiers declarator declaration-list? compound-statement

declaration =
    declaration-specifiers init-declarator-list? `;` |
    static_assert-declaration

init-declarator-list = init-declarator (`,` init-declarator)*

init-declarator = declarator (`=` initializer)?
</pre>

<p>This allows us to transform the rule for external declarations by expanding
<code>function-definition</code> and <code>declaration</code> to give:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration =
    declaration-specifiers declarator declaration-list? compound-statement |
    declaration-specifiers init-declarator-list? `;` |
    static_assert-declaration
</pre>

<p>The <code>static_assert-declaration</code> clause can be put first because it
begins with a distinctive keyword, and the common left factor
<code>declaration-specifiers</code> can be taken out, to yield:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration =
    static_assert-declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (
        declarator declaration-list? compound-statement |
        init-declarator-list? `;`
    )
</pre>

<p>Expanding <code>init-declarator-list</code> gives:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration =
    static_assert-declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (
        declarator declaration-list? compound-statement |
        (init-declarator (`,` init-declarator)*)? `;`
    )
</pre>

<p>Expanding the first <code>init-declarator</code> gives:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration =
    static_assert-declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (
        declarator declaration-list? compound-statement |
        (declarator (`=` initializer)? (`,` init-declarator)*)? `;`
    )
</pre>

<p>In order to get at the common left factor <code>declarator</code>, the second
alternative, which has the form <code>(x)? `;`</code>, can be replaced by
<code>x `;` / `;`</code> to give:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration =
    static_assert-declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (
        declarator declaration-list? compound-statement |
        declarator (`=` initializer)? (`,` init-declarator)* `;` |
        `;`
    )
</pre>

<p>Taking out the left factor <code>declarator</code> from the first two
alternatives gives:</p>

<pre class="c11">external-declaration =
    static_assert-declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (
        declarator (
            declaration-list? compound-statement |
            (`=` initializer)? (`,` init-declarator)* `;`
        ) |
        `;`
    )
</pre>

<p>Looking at the two innermost alternatives, the second can clearly only start
with a token <code>`=`</code> or <code>`,`</code> or
<code>`;`</code>. It is easy to check that the first alternative
cannot start with any of these, so no lookahead is necessary any more.</p>

<p>Converting to Pecan notation, adding some actions, and rearranging a bit,
gives:</p>

<pre class="pecan">external-declaration =
    static_assert-declaration @1declaration /
    declaration-specifiers (
        `;` @1declaration /
        declarator (
            (`=` initializer)? (`,` init-declarator)* `;` @1declaration /
            declaration-list? compound-statement @1definition
        )
    )
</pre>

<p>It is worth pointing out that, since <code class="pecan">declarator</code>
includes function declarators, this grammar does not preclude a declaration of
the form <code>int f() = 3;</code>. A brief investigation of actual C compilers
suggests that this error is normally detected after, rather than during,
parsing.</p>

<p>The next stage is to deal with declarations</p>

<h2>Statements</h2>

<p>A third prototype, adding statement rules from A.2.3 of the standard, is</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c-parse-c.txt">c-parse-c.txt</a></p>

<p>The original main rule for statements is:</p>

<pre class="c11">
statement =
    labeled-statement |
    compound-statement |
    expression-statement |
    selection-statement |
    iteration-statement |
    jump-statement
</pre>

<p>Most statements begin with a distinctive keyword. A simple check reveals that
the only overlap of first tokens is that <code>labeled-statement</code> and
<code>expression-statement</code> can both start with an identifier. However,
only in the <code>labeled-statement</code> case is it immediately followed by a
colon. Thus the above rule can be translated trivially, and
<code>labeled-statement</code> can be given a simple two-token lookahead:</p>

<pre class="pecan">
statement =
    labeled-statement /
    compound-statement /
    expression-statement /
    selection-statement /
    iteration-statement /
    jump-statement

labeled-statement =
    [identifier `:`] statement /
    `case` constant-expression `:` statement /
    `default` `:` statement
</pre>

<p>The original rule for a compound statement is easily transformed directly
into:</p>

<pre class="pecan">compound-statement = `{` block-item* `}`
</pre>

<p>The original rule for a block item is:</p>

<pre class="c11">block-item = declaration | statement
</pre>

<p>The only overlap between the first tokens of the two alternatives is that a
declaration may start with an identifier which is a typedef name, and a
statement may begin with an identifier. Typedef names need to be recognised
separately. That is done by adding an action to the grammar at the point where
a typedef name is declared, as well as actions which keep track of scopes. The
action causes the externally linked code to record the new typedef name in a
symbol table. Thereafter, within the scope of the typedef name, tokens matching
the typedef name are presented to the parser with a different token type. In
addition, it is necessary to <em>remove</em> the rule from the grammar for
typedef names:</p>

<pre class="c11">typedef-name = identifier
</pre>

<p>It can be replaced by a rule which indicated that it is a token type:</p>

<pre class="pecan">typedef-name = `typedef-name`
</pre>

<p>With this understanding, the rule for block items can be accepted as it
is:</p>

<pre class="pecan">block-item = declaration / statement
</pre>

<p>The rule for expression statements is unproblematic:</p>

<pre class="pecan">expression-statement = expression? `;`
</pre>

<p>With selection statements, the original rule is:</p>

<pre class="c11">selection-statement =
    `if` `(` expression `)` statement |
    `if` `(` expression `)` statement `else` statement |
    `switch` `(` expression `)` statement

<p>This suffers from the infamous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else">dangling else</a> ambiguity.
There is a well-known technique for resolving the ambiguity by having separate
rules for open and closed statements. That technique only applies to CFG
grammars, and doesn't directly help in transforming into Pecan (except perhaps
to clarify the meaning of the original grammar). However, the problem simply
goes away, if the obvious Pecan rule is written down. By the very nature of the
'greedy' <code>/</code> operator, an <code>else</code> clause will naturally be
attached to the closest <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<pre class="pecan">selection-statement =
    `if` `(` expression `)` statement (`else` statement)? /
    `switch` `(` expression `)` statement
</pre>

<p>The rule for iteration statements starts out as:</p>

<pre class="c11">iteration-statement =
    `while` `(` expression `)` statement |
    `do` statement `while` `(` expression `)` `;` |
    `for` `(` expression? `;` expression? `;` expression? `)` statement |
    `for` `(` declaration expression? `;` expression? `)` statement
</pre>

<p>The only problem is with the last pair of alternatives concerning
<code>for</code> statements. The last alternatives look slightly odd, as if it
lacks a semicolon. That's because a declaration includes its terminating
semicolon. Given the treatment of typedef names already described, declarations
and expressions are easily distinguished by their first tokens, so the rule can
be transformed to:</p>

<pre class="pecan">iteration-statement =
    `while` `(` expression `)` statement /
    `do` statement `while` `(` expression `)` `;` /
    `for` `(` for-start expression? `;` expression? `)` statement

for-start = declaration / expression? `;`
</pre>

<p>The rule for jump statements can be transformed directly into:</p>

<pre class="pecan">jump-statement =
    `goto` identifier `;` /
    `continue` `;` /
    `break` `;` /
    `return` expression? `;`
</pre>
