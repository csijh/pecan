<h1>The C scanner</h1>

<p>The complete Pecan scanner for C11, and a small collection of tests, are in
the files:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c-scan.txt">c-scan.txt</a><br/>
<a href="c-scan-test.txt">c-scan-test.txt</a></p>

<p>The scanner is based on the lexical grammar which is gathered together in
appendix A.1 of the standard. It is assumed that the implementation-defined
source character set consists of the visible Unicode characters, and that the
character encoding is UTF-8. It is also assumed that conversion of all newlines
to <code>\n</code>, translation of trigraphs, splicing of lines which end in
<code>\</code>, combining of consecutive string literals, and preprocessing have
already been done. Scanning does not then involve any changes to the source
text.</p>

<h2>Tokens</h2>

<p>The initial rule of the scanner is:</p>

<pre class="pecan">tokens = @Tokens token* &lt;>
</pre>

<p>To ensure that the scanner produces a single output, there is an initial
action <code class="pecan">@Tokens</code> which produces an empty list of
tokens. As each token is recognized, an action adds the token to the list. The
action name is intended to be used as the token's tag name, e.g. <code
class="pecan">@1Identifier</code> produces a token which will be matched by a
tag <code class="pecan">%Identifier</code> in the parser. The end of file is
recognized using <code class="pecan">&lt;></code>. The original rule for a token
from the standard is:</p>

<pre class="c11">token = keyword | identifier | constant | string-literal | punctuator
</pre>

<p>In order to take a uniform approach to scanning, white space and comments,
described elsewhere in the standard, are included, so that all of the text is
processed. (Technically, these are supposed to be handled during preprocessing,
but they have been left in here for illustrative purposes.)</p>

<p>The order of the alternatives is changed to recognise string literals and
constants before keywords or identifiers, because of the ambiguity between
encoding prefixes on literals and identifiers. Keywords are recognized before
identifiers, to keep the definition of identifiers simple, as in the original
grammar. So the translated rule is:</p>

<pre class="pecan">token =
    gap / comment / constant / string-literal / keyword /
    identifier / punctuator
</pre>

<p>White
space and comments can be recognized by:</p>

<pre class="pecan">gap = (' ' / newline / tab / vtab / formfeed)+ @

comment =
    "//" (newline! visible)* @ /
    "/*" ("*/"! visible)* "*/" @
</pre>

<p>The action <code class="pecan">@</code> is used to discard the white space
and comments, once matched.</p>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<p>In C, as in many languages, a word like <code>int</code> is not recognized as
a keyword if it is followed by more letters or digits. For example
<code>intx</code> is an identifier, not the keyword <code>int</code> followed by
<code>x</code>. This fact is not entirely clear from the original grammar, which
has a local ambiguity at this point. Although it can be argued according to CFG
semantics that such ambiguities get resolved at a more global level, it is much
clearer to resolve them locally. Many such ambiguities, including this one, can
be resolved using a greedy convention, sometimes called maximal munch, where it
is assumed that the longest alternative is the one intended. To deal with this,
lookahead is used to check that a keyword is not followed by a letter or
digit:</p>

<pre class="pecan">k = (identifier-nondigit / digit)!

keyword
= ["alignof" k] @1Alignof
/ ["auto" k] @1Auto
...
/ ["_Thread_local" k] @1ThreadLocal
</pre>

<p>The rule <code>k</code> checks that there is no following letter or digit. A
try construct <code>[...]</code> is used to backtrack if a keyword is not
properly matched.</p>

<p>A direct translation of this grammar into a scanner function as a series of
tests would be inefficient. An translation using dividers would improve
efficiency. However, each word would potentially still be examined twice, once
as a possible keyword, and then again as an identifier. The traditional way to
improve the efficiency further is to move the keyword checking from the grammar
into the externally attached code, which looks up words in a hash table to
decide if they are keywords or identifiers.</p>

<h2>Identifiers</h2>

<p>Identifiers exclude the keywords, which have already been matched. They
include type names introduced using <code>typedef</code>, and enumeration
constants, which can't be distinguished in the scanner, and must be recognized
later during parsing. The original rule for identifiers is:</p>

<pre class="c11">identifier =
    identifier-nondigit |
    identifier identifier-nondigit |
    identifier digit
</pre>

<p>Many of the original grammar rules use left recursion in this simple way to
express repetition. Such rules can usually be translated in a routine way using
repetition operators like this:</p>

<pre class="pecan">identifier =
    identifier-nondigit (identifier-nondigit / digit)* @1Identifier
</pre>

<p>Using Unicode letters in place of "other implementation-defined characters",
the remaining translated rules for identifiers are:</p>

<pre class="pecan">identifier-nondigit = nondigit / universal-character-name / other

nondigit = '_' / 'A..Z' / 'a..z'

digit = '0..9'

hexadecimal-digit = '0123456789abcdefABCDEF'

other = Lu / Ll / Lt / Lm / Lo
</pre>

<h2>Universal character names</h2>

<p>The rules for universal character names are easily transformed:</p>

<pre class="pecan">universal-character-name = "\u" hex-quad / "\U" hex-quad hex-quad

hex-quad =
    hexadecimal-digit hexadecimal-digit hexadecimal-digit hexadecimal-digit
</pre>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>Constants are described in the original grammar by:</p>

<pre class="c11">constant =
    integer-constant | floating-constant |
    enumeration-constant | character-constant
</pre>

<p>Enumeration constants can't be distinguished from identifiers in the scanner,
so they need to be removed from this rule and dealt with in the parser.
Numerical
constants cause a problem, because both integer and floating constants can start
with digits. It is possible to translate directly into a Pecan grammar rule by
using lookahead to try one alternative and then the other:</p>

<pre class="c11">constant =
    character-constant / [integer-constant] / floating-constant
</pre>

<p>It is tempting to try to improve on this by using a transformation approach
to find an equivalent form where no lookahead is needed. However, this turns
out to be impossible. That's because, for example, the source text
<code>08</code> is technically two tokens because <code>8</code> is not an octal
digit, whereas the three characters <code>08.</code> form a single floating
constant. That means, after accepting the <code>0</code>, lookahead is needed
at least as far as the dot before knowing whether the token has ended.
Detection of non-octal digits in octal constants could be left until a later
semantic pass, but perhaps a better approach is to find a cheap lookahead which
looks for the first non-digit.</p>

<pre class="pecan">constant =
    character-constant @1Constant /
    is-float! integer-constant @1Constant /
    floating-constant @1Constant

is-float = "0x" ('.' / hexadecimal-digit+ '.pP') / ('.' / digit+ '.eE')
</pre>

<p>The original rule for <code>integer-constant</code> is:</p>

<pre class="c11">integer-constant =
    decimal-constant integer-suffix? |
    octal-constant integer-suffix? |
    hexadecimal-constant integer-suffix?
</pre>

<p>This is another place in the C11 grammar where there is a local ambiguity. If
the source text contains <code>0x1</code> then this could match
<code>hexadecimal-constant</code>, or the first <code>0</code> on its own could
match <code>octal-constant</code>. The greedy convention suggests that the
hexadecimal case should be checked first:</p>

<pre class="pecan">integer-constant =
    hexadecimal-constant integer-suffix? /
    octal-constant integer-suffix? /
    decimal-constant integer-suffix?
</pre>

<p>One of the alternatives for a floating constant is a decimal floating
constant, with this original rule:</p>

<pre class="c11">decimal-floating-constant =
    fractional-constant exponent-part? floating-suffix? |
    digit-sequence exponent-part floating-suffix?
</pre>

<p>The alternatives have possible initial digits in common, so this needs some
work. The original rule for <code>fractional-constant</code> is:</p>

<pre class="c11">fractional-constant =
    digit-sequence? '.' digit-sequence |
    digit-sequence '.'
</pre>

<p>This is typical of many rules where there is a common left factor which is
reasonably easy to transform away using a sequence of routine transformations.
The first alternative can be expanded into two alternatives, according to
whether the optional <code>digit-sequence</code> is absent or present:</p>

<pre class="c11">fractional-constant =
    '.' digit-sequence |
    digit-sequence '.' digit-sequence |
    digit-sequence '.'
</pre>

<p>Then the last two alternatives can be combined, and the choice operator
changed:</p>

<pre class="c11">fractional-constant =
    '.' digit-sequence /
    digit-sequence '.' digit-sequence?
</pre>

<p>This can now be substituted into the <code>decimal-floating-constant</code>
rule, and similar transformations applied to the result, to give:</p>

<pre class="pecan">decimal-floating-constant:
    '.' digit-sequence exponent-part? floating-suffix? /
    digit-sequence ('.' digit-sequence?)? exponent-part? floating-suffix?
</pre>

<p>Character constants may have an encoding prefix before the <code>"'"</code>.
To avoid a clash with identifiers, a small amount of lookahead, just two
characters, is needed. Pecan's string notation is sufficient for this:</p>

<pre class="pecan">character-constant =
    ("'" / "L'" / "u'" / "U'") c-char-sequence "'"
</pre>

<p>The remaining rules for constants can be easily dealt with.</p>

<h2>String literals</h2>

<p>String literals are described in the original grammar by:</p>

<pre class="c11">string-literal = encoding-prefix? '"' s-char-sequence? '"'

encoding-prefix = "u8" | "u" | "U" | "L"
</pre>

<p>This can be translated into:</p>

<pre class="pecan">string-literal =
    '"' s-char-sequence? '"' /
    [encoding-prefix '"'] s-char-sequence? '"'

encoding-prefix = "u8" / "u" / "U" / "L"
</pre>

<p>The try construct <code class="pecan">[encoding-prefix '"']</code> deals with
the overlap between prefixes and identifiers.</p>

<h2>Punctuators</h2>

<p>Punctuators are easier to recognize than keywords, because it doesn't matter
what they are followed by. However, they have to be ordered so that if one is a
prefix of another, the longer one is earlier and recognized preferentially,
according to the greedy convention. Perhaps the easiest way to be sure of that
is to list them in order of length.</p>

<pre class="pecan">punctuator
= "%:%:" @PercentColonPercentColon
/ "<<=" @LessLessEquals
/ ">>=" @GreaterGreaterEquals
/ "..." @DotDotDot
/ "->" @Arrow
...
/ "#" @Hash
</pre>

<p>The same approach can be taken to the remaining original lexical rules.</p>

<p>Although this translation of the C11 lexical rules has involved some work, it
has had the effect of exposing and resolving some issues.</p>
