<h1>Transliteration</h1>

<p>The grammar rules from Appendix A of the C11 standard have been extracted,
and a few obvious cosmetic changes carried out for compatibility with Pecan.
The result is presented in this file, which acts as a starting point for
transformations.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c11-grammar.txt">c11-grammar.txt</a></p>

<p>Terminal symbols in bold such as <b><code>int</code></b> are quoted as
<code>"int"</code> instead. Definitions <code>x: y</code> have the colon
replaced by an equal sign to give <code>x = y</code>, the optional suffix
<code>x<sub>opt</sub></code> is replaced by a question mark <code>x?</code>, and
choices which are implicit from the layout have explicit choice operators
<code>|</code> added.  Rules are effectively presented in a mythical language
which is Pecan with an extra <code>|</code> operator having CFG semantics. The
aim will be to apply transformations until the alternatives of any CFG choice
operator <code>|</code> can clearly be distinguished by Pecan's choice operator
<code>/</code> instead, so that the <code>|</code> operator can be
eliminated.</p>

<p>During transformations of the grammar, rules taken from the above file, or
needing more transformation work, are displayed in <code
class="c11">blue</code>, whereas final Pecan rules are displayed in <code
class="pecan">green</code>.</p>
