<h1>Transliteration</h1>

<p>The first stage is to extract the rules from Appendix A of the C11 standard,
and carry out a few obvious cosmetic changes for compatibility with Pecan.  The
result is presented in this file, which acts as a starting point for
transformations.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="c11-grammar.txt">c11-grammar.txt</a></p>

<p>Terminal symbols in bold such as <b><code>int</code></b> are quoted as
<code>"int"</code> instead. Definitions <code>x: y</code> have the colon
replaced by an equal sign to give <code>x = y</code>, the optional suffix
<code>x<sub>opt</sub></code> is replaced by a question mark <code>x?</code>, and
choices which are implicit from the layout have explicit choice operators
<code>|</code> added.  Rules are effectively presented in a mythical language
which is Pecan with an extra <code>|</code> operator having CFG semantics. The
aim is to apply transformations until the alternatives of any <code>|</code>
operator can clearly be distinguished by the PEG operator <code>/</code>
instead, so that the <code>|</code> operator can be eliminated.</p>

<p>The transformations of the rules will be described in the order of their
appearance in appendix A of the C11 standard, and the result will be presented
as a separate scanner and parser. During transformations, rules taken from the
standard, or needing more transformation work, are displayed in <code
class="c11">blue</code>, whereas final Pecan rules are displayed in <code
class="pecan">green</code>.  In describing transformations, only the first
example of each straightforward technique, plus awkward issues, will be
described.</p>
