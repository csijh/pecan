<h1>A calculator</h1>

<p>Suppose we want to implement a calculator where the user can type in a sum
such as <kbd>6+3*(10+2)</kbd> and get the answer <samp>42</samp>. A calculator
like this consists mostly of a parser for arithmetic expressions. Although it
would be easy to write by hand, developing it using Pecan illustrates Pecan's
features and the way it supports the development of a parser in a step-by-step,
test-driven fashion.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>To make a start, create a file <code>sum.txt</code> containing:</p>

<pre>digit = '0..9' @value
</pre>

<p>This can be thought of as a prototype parser. It specifies a parsing function
called <code>digit</code> which recognises a single digit and then uses an
action <code>@value</code> to evaluate it. An expression such as
<code>'0'</code> in a definition matches a specific character in the input, and
<code>'0..9'</code> matches any character in the given range. An action such
as <code>@value</code> represents an operation to be applied to the text
matched so far.</p>

<p>An action such as <code>@value</code> can be thought of as representing an
external function call in the final parser which will be written or generated
when the prototype is complete. The function will generate an output item of
some kind. In this case, we are thinking of output items as numbers, but in
some other application such as a compiler, output items could be syntax
trees.</p>

<p>The prototype parser doesn't make external calls, but it can be tested
symbolically as it stands. Create a file <code>sum-test.txt</code>, like
this:</p>

<pre>{sum.txt}
==========
2
..........
value 2
</pre>

<p>The test file is divided into two parts by a line of equal signs. The first
part imports the grammar to be used for subsequent tests. The second part is a
test, divided by a line of dots into the input and the expected output. The
output produced represents the external calls which would be made by the final
parser, in this case a call to a function <code>value</code> with an argument
which represents the substring <code>"2"</code> of the input text.</p>

<p>If we don't know exactly what output we are expecting, we can put in a guess
and correct it later. Then we can run the test like this:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 1 test.
</pre>

<p>It is assumed here that <code>pecan</code> is an alias for whatever command
has to be typed to run the pecan program, perhaps:</p>

<pre>java -jar pecan.jar sum-test.txt
Pass 1 test.
</pre>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>To extend the parser to handle multi-digit numbers, edit the parser in
<code>sum.txt</code> to read:</p>

<pre>number = ('0..9')+ @value
</pre>

<p>The postfix operator <code>+</code> means that the parser should try to match
something one or more times. In this case, a number consists of one or more
digits. To see if this works, add another test to the file
<code>sum-test.txt</code> so that it now contains:</p>

<pre>{sum.txt}
==========
2
..........
value 2
==========
42
..........
value 42
</pre>

<p>Over time, the test file can contain various parser fragments or parser
versions and their tests, representing the entire history of development. For
the calculator, we are discarding previous versions of the parser, but keeping
all the tests to make sure they still work:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 2 tests.
</pre>

<p>We are making progress.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>To extend the parser to handle two numbers added together such as
<code>2+40</code>, edit the parser in <code>sum.txt</code> to
read:</p>

<pre>sum = number / number '+' number @2add
number = ('0..9')+ @value
</pre>

<p>The <code>/</code> operator means "or", so the parser should recognise
either a single number, or two numbers with a plus sign in between, in which
case a function <code>add</code> is to be called to evaluate the sum. The
<code>2</code> in <code>@2add</code> indicates that the <code>add</code>
function is to be applied to the two previously created output items, rather
than to text from the input. Add a third test to the file:</p>

<pre>{sum.txt}
==========
2
..........
value 2
==========
42
..........
value 42
==========
2+40
..........
value 2
value 40
add
</pre>

<p>The final three lines describe the calls which we would expect to be made by
the generated code, i.e. two calls to <code>value</code> followed by a call
to <code>add</code>, using the results of the previous calls as arguments.
Running the tests gives:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Fail test on line 11 of sum-test.txt:
.......... Expected ..........
value 2
value 40
add
.......... Actual ..........
value 2
</pre>

<p>This is a good opportunity to demonstrate a couple of Pecan features:</p>

<pre>pecan -trace sum-test.txt 11
I1: |2+40
P1: sum = number / number '+' number @2add
P1: number / number '+' number @2add
P1: number
P2: ('0..9')+ @value
P2: ('0..9')+
P2: '0..9'
I1: 2|+40
P2: '0..9'
P2: @value
O: value 2
Fail test on line 11 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
value 2
value 40
add
---------- Actual ----------
value 2
</pre>

<p>A numerical argument to the <code>pecan</code> program represents the line
number of a single test in the test file. This makes sure only one test is run.
The <code style="white-space: nowrap">-trace</code> (or <code
style="white-space: nowrap">-t</code>) option switches on trace output. Although
verbose, this can sometimes be used to resolve difficult issues. Each line in
the trace starts with <code>I</code>, <code>P</code> or <code>O</code>. A line
starting with <code>I</code> reports a change in the input position, giving an
input line number and marking the position in that line with a vertical bar. A
line starting with <code>P</code> reports a change in the current parse
expression being executed, displaying a parser line number and the expression. A
line starting with <code>O</code> reports an output action.</p>

<p>The trace shows that the parser has a choice <code>number / number '+'
...</code>, and the first alternative succeeds, so the second alternative isn't
tried. The choice operator <code>/</code> is sequential, as in PEG grammars, not
symmetrical like the <code>|</code> operator in CFG grammars. Also, our parser
doesn't yet specify that parsing must reach the end of the input, so recognising
just the first number from the input gives a successful result.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Maybe we can fix things by changing the order of choice. Change the rules
in <kbd>sum.txt</kbd> to:</p>

<pre>sum = number '+' number @2add / number
number = ('0..9')+ @value
</pre>

<p>Now running the tests gives:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Fail test on line 3 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
value 2
---------- Actual ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 3:
2
 ^
</pre>

<p>We have broken the first test, which used to work. It is very common to break
old tests, which is why we are keeping all the tests and re-running them in
every development step.</p>

<p>The reason the first test now fails is that the parser has made a start on
the first alternative <code>number '+' number @2add</code>, and the initial
part, <code>number</code>, has succeeded. The parser is now committed to this
first alternative, which then fails because there is no plus sign. By default,
a parser is committed to an alternative as soon as any progress is made.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>

<p>It is possible to specify the point at which the parser is committed to the
first alternative:</p>

<pre>sum = [number '+'] number @2add / number
number = ('0..9')+ @value
</pre>

<p>The square brackets indicate that the parser should commit to the first
alternative after the plus sign is found. If there is no plus sign, the
parser should backtrack to the beginning and try the second alternative.</p>

<p>However, this may involve re-parsing the first number. To keep parsers
efficient, it is best to use backtracking very sparingly, so let's try
something else.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>

<p>A better approach for our calculator is to recognise the first number, and
then look to see whether or not there is a following plus sign:</p>

<pre>sum = number ('+' number @2add)?
number = ('0..9')+ @value
</pre>

<p>The postfix operator <code>?</code> means that something is
optional, so <code>x?</code> represents a choice between <code>x</code> or
nothing. Running our tests now gives:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Fail test on line 11 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
value 2
value 40
add
---------- Actual ----------
value 2
value +40
add
</pre>

<p>Well, at least the first test is working again. The final test is nearly
working, except for the plus sign on the front of the number 40. That's
because every character in the input must be handled by some action. An action
such as <code>value</code> is passed all the characters matched since the
previous action.</p>

<h3>Step 7</h3>

<p>Since we don't need the plus sign once it has been matched,
we can add an action which discards it:</p>

<pre>sum = number ('+' @ number @2add)?
number = ('0..9')+ @value
</pre>

<p>An <code>@</code> sign on its own is an action which discards all characters
matched since the previous action. Does this finally sort out our tests?</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 3 tests.
</pre>

<p>Yes, it does.</p>

<h3>Step 8</h3>

<p>At this point, it might be just as well to solve the problem of making sure
that all the input is used:</p>

<pre>sum = number ('+' @ number @2add)? end
number = ('0..9')+ @value
end = '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>A number such as <code>13</code> is the decimal code for a character, in this
case the carriage return control character <code>\r</code> also known as
<code>CR</code> or <code>CTRL+M</code> or <code>0D</code> (hexadecimal), and
<code>10</code> stands for the line feed control character <code>\n</code> also
known as <code>LF</code> or <code>CTRL+J</code> or <code>0A</code>
(hexadecimal).</p>

<p>Pecan normalizes the line endings of the test file when it is read in, so
they are all <code>'\10'</code>, but the <code>end</code> definition covers the two
most common line ending conventions, which would make the final parser work on
most common platforms, without normalizing the input.</p>

<p>The <code>@</code> action discards the end-of-line character or characters
after matching them. Another test can be added to our file to make sure that the
parser reports an error if the end of the input isn't reached.</p>

<pre>...
==========
2+40%
..........
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17:
2+40%
    ^
</pre>

<p>The test says that the parser should produce an error with a specific
message. If it does, the test succeeds:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 4 tests.
</pre>

<p>The error message in the last test isn't very good, because it doesn't
provide a reason for the failure. That's because we haven't specified any error
reporting details yet. For now, it is enough to point to the place where the
failure occurs.</p>

<h3>Step 9</h3>

<p>Now let's deal with any sequence of numbers added together.</p>

<pre>sum = number ('+' @ number @2add)* end
number = ('0..9')+ @value
end = '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>All we've done is to replace the <code>?</code> operator by the
<code>*</code> operator, which says that something is to be repeated any number
of times. Unlike the <code>+</code> operator, it specifies zero or more times,
rather than one or more times. We can add a test:</p>

<pre>...
==========
2+10+12+18
..........
value 2
value 10
add
value 12
add
value 18
add
</pre>

<p>Running the tests produces:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 5 tests.
</pre>

<p>All is well.</p>

<h3>Step 10</h3>

<p>The next step is to allow subtraction as well as addition:</p>

<pre>sum = number ('+' @ number @2add / '-' @ number @2subtract)* end
number = ('0..9')+ @value
end = '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>A number can be followed by any number of clauses. Each clause is either a
plus sign or a minus sign followed by another number. Add an extra test for
subtraction:</p>

<pre>...
==========
2-10+53-3
..........
value 2
value 10
subtract
value 53
add
value 3
subtract
</pre>

<p>Run the tests:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 6 tests.
</pre>

<p>We are making good progress.</p>

<h3>Step 11</h3>

<p>At this point, let's do something about the uninformative error messages.
Here is the one in our current test file:</p>

<pre>2+40%
..........
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17:
2+40%
    ^
</pre>

<p>This accurately reports the position in the input at which parsing failed,
but doesn't give any clue about why. The conventional approach is to list the
things which would allow further parsing. If the list were generated
automatically, it might read:</p>

<pre>2+40%
..........
Error... expecting '0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','+','-','\13','\10'
2+40%
    ^
</pre>

<p>Messages like this are too long and detailed to be very useful. We need to
form a summary. To do that, we can add error handlers to the parser:</p>

<pre>sum = number ('+' @ number @2add / '-' @ number @2subtract)* end
number = (#digit '0..9')+ @value
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>If we run the Pecan program on our test file, we get this:</p>

<pre>java pecan.Run tests/sum11.txt
Fail test on line 17 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17:
2+40%
    ^
---------- Actual ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17: expecting digit, newline
2+40%
    ^
</pre>

<p>When an error handler such as <code>#digit</code> is encountered, it is
attached as a marker to the current position in the input. If progress is made
beyond that position, the marker is removed. If parsing fails, the markers
associated with the current input position are reported. In the example here,
the <code>#digit</code> handler summarises the set of digits which are expected,
and the handler <code>#newline</code> summarises the line endings.</p>

<p>If the error message is changed in the test file to match what is actually
reported, the tests all pass. A further test can be added to cover the case
where there is no number after an operator:</p>

<pre>...
==========
2+
..........
Error in sum-test.txt, line 43: expecting digit
2+
  ^
</pre>

<p>Running the tests gives:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 7 tests.
</pre>

<p>This is good, but we need a more uniform approach to error handling to make
sure it is accurate.</p>

<h3>Step 12</h3>

<p>The operators <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> are not being reported
because there is no handler for them. Although it is often reasonable to leave
out relatively unimportant items from the 'expected' list, the operators ought
to be reported in our case. For uniformity, let's make sure that whenever a
character is matched in the input, there is a marker associated with it. We can
rewrite the parser as:</p>

<pre>sum = number (plus number @2add / minus number @2subtract)* end
number = digit+ @value
plus = #operator '+' @
minus = #operator '-' @
digit = #digit '0..9'
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>Each expression where a character is recognised has been pulled out into its
own definition, with an error handler included. This is a rather minor example
of the transformation approach to parser development. We started with a
parser:</p>

<pre>sum = ... '+' @ ...
</pre>

<p>Then we transformed it by pulling a subexpression out into its own
rule before developing further:</p>

<pre>sum = ... plus ...
plus = '+' @
</pre>

<p>There are many transformations like this which can be performed on a Pecan
parser which are guaranteed not to change its meaning. For any input, the output
actions performed or the error report produced are not changed.</p>

<p>Running the tests produces:</p>

<pre>Fail test on line 17 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17: expecting digit, newline
2+40%
    ^
---------- Actual ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17: expecting digit, newline, operator
2+40%
    ^
</pre>

<p>This shows that operators are now being reported. If we upgrade the error
message in the test file, the tests pass. The error handler
<code>#operator</code> is encountered twice while parsing, once for each
operator, but is only reported once.</p>

<h3>Step 13</h3>

<p>It is time to add the other two operators:</p>

<pre>sum = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)* end
term = number (times number @2multiply / over number @2divide)*
number = digit+ @value
plus = #operator '+' @
minus = #operator '-' @
times = #operator '*' @
over = #operator '/' @
digit = #digit '0..9'
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>Using the two separate rules <code>sum</code> and <code>term</code> means
that we have specified that multiplication and division take precedence over
addition and subtraction. We need to add at least one more test to make sure
this is working:</p>

<pre>...
==========
5*8+12/6
..........
value 5
value 8
multiply
value 12
value 6
divide
add
</pre>

<p>Running the tests gives:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 8 tests.
</pre>

<p>Now all the operators are in place, it is time to tackle brackets.</p>

<h3>Step 14</h3>

<p>Let's add a rule <code>atom</code> to mean either a number or a bracketed
subexpression:</p>

<pre>sum = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)* end
term = atom (times atom @2multiply / over atom @2divide)*
atom = number / open sum close
number = digit+ @value
plus = #operator '+' @
minus = #operator '-' @
times = #operator '*' @
over = #operator '/' @
open = #bracket '(' @
close = #bracket ')' @
digit = #digit '0..9'
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>Running the existing tests shows up a slight problem:</p>

<pre>Fail test on line 43 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 43: expecting digit
2+
  ^
---------- Actual ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 43: expecting bracket, digit
2+
  ^
</pre>

<p>The error message in that test needs to be upgraded in the test file. Now we
can add a simple test for brackets:</p>

<pre>...
==========
2*(20+1)
..........
value 2
value 20
value 1
add
multiply
</pre>

<p>Running the tests gives:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Fail test on line 59 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
value 2
value 20
value 1
add
multiply
---------- Actual ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 59: expecting digit, newline, operator
2*(20+1)
       ^
</pre>

<p>The new test for brackets fails. That is because we are using
the <code>sum</code> rule both for the expression as a whole, where we expect
the end of the input to follow, and for the inner subexpression, where we
expect a closing bracket to follow. We need to separate out these two
cases.</p>

<h3>Step 15</h3>

<p>All we need to do is to add an extra rule <code>expression</code> which is
the same as <code>sum</code>, but without the end of input test:</p>

<pre>sum = expression end
expression = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)*
term = atom (times atom @2multiply / over atom @2divide)*
atom = number / open expression close
number = digit+ @value
plus = #operator '+' @
minus = #operator '-' @
times = #operator '*' @
over = #operator '/' @
open = #bracket '(' @
close = #bracket ')' @
digit = #digit '0..9'
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>Let's run the tests again:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 9 tests.
</pre>

<p>Now let's allow spaces.</p>

<h3>Step 16</h3>

<p>Handling spaces is a little bit difficult, because we are scanning and
parsing in one go, rather than writing a separate scanner and parser. Perhaps
the simplest approach is to skip spaces at the start, and after recognising each
token:</p>

<pre>sum = gap expression end
expression = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)*
term = atom (times atom @2multiply / over atom @2divide)*
atom = number / open expression close
number = digit+ @value gap
plus = #operator '+' gap
minus = #operator '-' gap
times = #operator '*' gap
over = #operator '/' gap
open = #bracket '(' gap
close = #bracket ')' gap
digit = #digit '0..9'
gap = (#space ' ')* @
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>A test can be added:</p>

<pre>...
==========
 2 * ( 20 + 1 )
..........
value 2
value 20
value 1
add
multiply
</pre>

<p>Running the tests gives:</p>

<pre>Fail test on line 17 of sum-test.txt:
---------- Expected ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17: expecting digit, newline, operator
2+40%
    ^
---------- Actual ----------
Error in sum-test.txt, line 17: expecting digit, newline, operator, space
2+40%
    ^
</pre>

<p>The error message is technically correct, but since spaces are allowed almost
anywhere, it seems rather fussy to mention them.</p>

<h3>Step 17</h3>

<p>Rather than change the error messages to add <code>space</code> as an extra
expected item, let's decide that error messages will look cleaner if spaces are
not reported. Also, there are no circumstances where one or more digits have
been matched, and a further digit is required. So let's remove the marker
<code>#digit</code> from the digit rule and put a marker <code>#integer</code>
on the number rule instead. The grammar becomes:</p>

<pre>sum = gap expression end
expression = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)*
term = atom (times atom @2multiply / over atom @2divide)*
atom = number / open expression close
number = #integer digit+ @value gap
plus = #operator '+' gap
minus = #operator '-' gap
times = #operator '*' gap
over = #operator '/' gap
open = #bracket '(' gap
close = #bracket ')' gap
digit = '0..9'
gap = (' ')* @
end = #newline '\13'? '\10' @
</pre>

<p>Running the tests again shows that there are error messages that need to
be adjusted, but after that:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt
Pass 10 tests.
</pre>

<p>Although there are many more features that could be added, let's stop and say
we have successfully developed an arithmetic expression parser.</p>

<h3>Step 18</h3>

<p>It is time to compile the grammar, in order to create a real calculator
program. We will illustrate with a program in C, but in principle the program
could be created in any language. The first thing to do is to write a skeleton
calculator program, in a file <kbd>sum.c</kbd>, say:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="sum.c">sum.c</a></p>

<p>The program contains a comment line containing <code>&lt;pecan></code>, and
another containing <code>&lt;/pecan></code>. When a grammar is compiled, any
lines between these two (presumably consisting of previously generated bytecode)
is removed, and the newly generated bytecode is inserted.</p>

<p>The command to compile the grammar, from a grammar file or from a test file
which contains the desired grammar at the top, is:</p>

<pre>pecan sum-test.txt -o sum.c
</pre>

<p>The program makes use of two provided files, which form a generic bytecode
interpreter module which can be used in any C project.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="interpret.h">interpret.h</a><br/>
<a href="interpret.c">interpret.c</a></p>

<p>The interpreter is written assuming that the UTF-8 input is a normal C
string, i.e. a <code>char</code> array with a null character as terminator. That
means the interpreter cannot properly detect the null character
<code>'\0'</code> within text, as is usual with the C language.</p>

<p>For simplicity, the C interpreter doesn't use dynamic allocation. The C
interpreter can be used as the basis for writing an interpreter in other
languages.</p>

<p>The program can be compiled with a standard-conforming compiler such as
<code>gcc</code> or </code>clang</code>:</p>

<pre>gcc -std=c11 -Wall -O2 sum.c interpret.c -o sum
</pre>

<p>When the program is run, it reads in an arithmetic expression from the
user, then prints out the result:</p>

<pre>./sum
2+2
4
</pre>

<p>In this case, the actions form an evaluator, but it would be just as easy to
specify a tree node class instead of <code>int</code> and to provide action
methods which build a parse tree.</p>
