<h1>Compiling a grammar</h1>

<p>Let's take the grammar previously developed for arithmetic expressions, and
compile it to form a calculator program. The grammar is:</p>

<pre>sum = gap expression end
expression = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)*
term = atom (times atom @2multiply / over atom @2divide)*
atom = number / open expression close
number = #integer digit+ @read gap
plus = #operator '+' gap
minus = #operator '-' gap
times = #operator '*' gap
over = #operator '/' gap
open = #bracket '(' gap
close = #bracket ')' gap
digit = '0..9'
gap = (' ')* @
end = #newline '\r'? '\n' @
</pre>

<p>We will illustrate with a program in C, but in principle the program could be
created in almost any programming language. Here is a module in C to provide the
parsing state and its supporting functions, together with two data files:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="parser.h">parser.h</a><br/>
<a href="parser.c">parser.c</a><br/>
<a href="table1.bin">table1.bin</a><br/>
<a href="table2.bin">table2.bin</a></p>

<p>A program can be written to parse sums, described in detail below:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="sum.c">sum.c</a></p>

<p>Suppose the grammar is stored in a file <code>sum.txt</code>. It can be
compiled with:</p>

<pre>pecan sum.txt -c sum.c
</pre>

<p>The program <code>sum.c</code> is read in, a few lines are extracted from it
which specify how rules are to be compiled to C functions, and the compiled
functions are inserted into the program. The program can now be compiled with a
C compiler such as <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> and run:</p>

<pre>gcc -std=c11 -Wall -O3 -flto sum.c parse.c -o sum
./sum
Type a sum: 2+3*4
14
</pre>

<p>The <code>-std=c11</code> option specifies the 2011 standard for the C
language. The <code>-Wall</code> option switches on all common compiler
warnings. The <code>-O3</code> option (with a capital letter O) asks for a good
level of optimisation. The <code>-flto</code> option enables link time
optimisation, which allows the small functions in <code>parse.c</code> to be
inlined into the compiled functions in <code>sum.c</code>, so there is no loss
in defining the parser state in a separate module.</p>

<p>In this case, we have been a bit fortunate, because there are no name
clashes. In fact, the program contains three functions called <code>open</code>,
<code>close</code> and <code>read</code> which could clash with standard C
library functions in some circumstances. Below, we will see how the generated
names can be adjusted to avoid name clashes.</p>

<h2>The program</h2>

<p>The program <code>sum.c</code> begins with:</p>

<pre>// Error marker constants, and spellings.
enum marker { integer, operator, bracket, newline };
char *names[] = { "integer", "operator", "bracket", "newline" };
</pre>

<p>These are enumerated constants for each error marker mentioned in the
grammar, together with text to be printed for each constant. Their names must
match the marker names in the grammar, so that they can be referenced from the
compiled functions. The order of the constants in this definition determines the
order in which the items are listed in error messages. The support module
<code>parse.c</code> assumes that the constants are in the range
<code>0..63</code> so that a long integer can be used to store the current
marker bits. The next part of the program is:</p>

<pre>int read(char *s, int start, int end) { ... }
int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }
int subtract(int x, int y) { return x - y; }
int multiply(int x, int y) { return x * y; }
int divide(int x, int y) { return x / y; }
</pre>

<p>These are the action functions, either creating an output item from text, or
constructing one from previous output items. Their names should match the action
names in the grammar. The next part of the program is:</p>

<pre>bool sum(parser *p);
</pre>

<p>This is a forward declaration of the first compiled function, which acts as
an entry point for parsing. The main function comes next:</p>

<pre>int main() {
  char in[100];
  printf("Type a sum: ");
  char *r = fgets(in, 100, stdin);
  if (r == NULL) printf("Can't read stdin\n");
  parser *p = newParser(strlen(in), in);
  bool ok = sum(p);
  if (ok) printf("%ld\n", topI(p,0));
  else report(p, "Syntax error:\n", "Error: expecting %s, %s\n", names);
  freeParser(p);
}
</pre>

<p>This reads an arithmetic expression from the user, creates a parser
structure, and calls the <code>sum</code> function. After parsing, the
<code>topI</code> function extracts the top integer from the stack, i.e. the
result. There is a call to the support function <code>report</code> to print a
suitable error message if parsing fails. The final part of the program is:</p>

<pre>// &lt;pecan
//   comment  = "// %s"
//   declare  = "bool %s(parser *p);"
//   define   = "bool %s(parser *p) { %n return %r; %n}"
//   call     = "%s(p)"
//   act0     = "pushI(p,0,%s(text(p),start(p),at(p)))"
//   act2     = "pushI(p,2,%s(topI(p,1),topI(p,0)))"
//   escape1  = "\%3o"
//   escape2  = "\u%4x"
//   escape4  = "\U%8x"
// >

// &lt;/pecan>. End of generated functions.
</pre>

<p>When a grammar is compiled, the generated functions are inserted between the
<code>&lt;pecan></code> and <code>&lt;/pecan></code> tags. The tags have a
similar style to HTML and are commented out using C comments. Any text already
present between the tags is deleted. That means compiling can be repeated as
necessary. The <code>&lt;pecan></code> tag contains attributes. These define
print formats that are used to generate the parsing functions from the grammar
rules.</p>

<p>The attributes shown here establish the C conventions for one-line comments,
forward declarations of functions allowing them to be recursive, definitions of
functions, and calls to functions. The <code>act0</code> and <code>act2</code>
attributes cover the compilation of actions for the calculator, using support
functions to deal with the changes to the parser state such as stack handling,
and calling the action functions. The support functions allow the hand-written
action functions to consist of pure manipulation of output values. The escape
attributes specify how control characters or Unicode characters appear in the
generated functions. Note that <code>escape1</code> is not defined as
<code>\x%2x</code> because in C a <code>\x</code> escape is variable-length with
no terminator, so can be damaged by a following digit.</p>

<p>Suppose the attributes were changed to:</p>

<pre>
// &lt;pecan
//   comment  = "// %s"
//   declare  = "bool P%s(parser *p);"
//   define   = "bool P%s(parser *p) { %n return %r; %n}"
//   call     = "%s(p)"
//   id       = "P%s(p)"
//   act0     = "pushI(p,0,A%s(text(p),start(p),at(p)))"
//   act2     = "pushI(p,2,A%s(topI(p,1),topI(p,0)))"
//   tag      = "tag(p,T%s)"
//   mark     = "mark(p,M%s)"
//   escape1  = "\%3o"
//   escape2  = "\u%4x"
//   escape4  = "\U%8x"
// >
</pre>

<p>These changes would mean that the names of all generated parsing functions
would be prefixed by <code>P</code>, all action function names by
<code>A</code>, all tag names by <code>T</code>, all error marker names by
<code>M</code>, thus guarding against any possible name clash, either between
the different types of name, or between the names and language keywords or
library functions.</p>

<p>The data files <code>table1.bin</code> and <code>table2.bin</code> can be
used in any programming language to form a two-stage table for looking up the
Unicode category of a character. They are only needed if Unicode categories are
mentioned in the grammar. They currently support Unicode version 12.0, and can
be used in languages with no suitable Unicode support or to make the Unicode
version recognised by the compiled parser independent of the version provided by
the target programming language. The files are used by reading them into byte
arrays in memory, and then looking up the category of an integer character code
<code>ch</code> using one of:</p>

<pre>table2[table1[ch>>8]*256+(ch&amp;255)];
table2[(table1[ch>>8]&amp;255)*256+(ch&amp;255)];
</pre>

<p>The first version is for languages which support unsigned bytes, and the
second is for languages which only support signed bytes. The category
enumeration in the <code>parse.h</code> header defines the categories in
alphabetical order, which is the order used in these tables.</p>
