<h1>Compiling a grammar</h1>

<p>Let's take the grammar previously developed for arithmetic expressions, and
compile it to form a calculator program. The grammar is:</p>

<pre>sum = gap expression end
expression = term (plus term @2add / minus term @2subtract)*
term = atom (times atom @2multiply / over atom @2divide)*
atom = number / open expression close
number = #integer digit+ @value gap
plus = #operator '+' gap
minus = #operator '-' gap
times = #operator '*' gap
over = #operator '/' gap
open = #bracket '(' gap
close = #bracket ')' gap
digit = '0..9'
gap = (' ')* @
end = #newline '\r'? '\n' @
</pre>

<p>We will illustrate with a program in C, but in principle the program could be
created in almost any programming language. Here is a skeleton parser program in
C, with two supporting data files:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="parse.c">parse.c</a><br/>
<a href="table1.bin">table1.bin</a><br/>
<a href="table2.bin">table2.bin</a></p>

<p>To compile the grammar, store it in a file <code>sum.txt</code>, say. Copy
the template program <code>parse.c</code> to <code>sum.c</code>, say. Adapt the
program for the current application. In this particular case, the program is
already suitable for our calculator:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="sum.c">sum.c</a></p>

<p>Compile the grammar with:</p>

<pre>pecan sum.txt -c sum.c
</pre>

<p>The program <code>sum.c</code> is read in, a few lines are extracted from it
which specify how rules are to be compiled to C functions, and the compiled
functions are inserted into the program. The program can now be compiled with a
C compiler such as <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> and run:</p>

<pre>gcc -std=c11 -Wall sum.c -o sum
./sum
Type a sum: 2+3*4
14
</pre>

<p>In this case, we have been a bit fortunate, because there are no name
clashes. In fact, two parsing functions have been generated called
<code>open</code> and <code>close</code>. Their names clash with standard C
library functions, which could cause problems in some circumstances. Below, we
will see how the generated names can be adjusted to avoid name clashes.</p>

<h2>The skeleton program</h2>

<p>The program <code>parse.c</code> can be adapted for most applications. It can
also be used as a starting point for writing a similar template for another
programming language. It has two sections. The first section is intended to be
adapted as required. The second section consists of generic parsing support
functions which need not be changed. The first part of the program is:</p>

<pre>typedef char input;
typedef int output;
</pre>

<p>This defines the input and output types for parsing. The input type is the
type of each item in the input array. It should be a byte for parsers based on
UTF-8 text. In C, it is normal to use <code>char</code> for text bytes, even
though they may be signed or unsigned depending on the platform, and to cast or
mask each byte when it is retrieved from the array. For a token-based parser,
the input type should be a token structure, or a pointer to a token structure,
depending on whether structures or structure pointers are stored in the input
array. The output can be anything which can be passed to and from functions,
e.g. a numerical type or a pointer to a tree node. The next part of the program
is:</p>

<pre>output value(int n, char s[n]) { ... }
output add(output x, output y) { return x + y; }
output subtract(output x, output y) { return x - y; }
output multiply(output x, output y) { return x * y; }
output divide(output x, output y) { return x / y; }
</pre>

<p>These are the action functions, either creating an output item from text, or
constructing one from previous output items. They should be adapted according to
the needs of the application and should match the action names used in the
grammar. The next part of the program is:</p>

<pre>enum marker { integer, operator, bracket, newline };
char *names[] = { "integer", "operator", "bracket", "newline" };
</pre>

<p>This should be adapted to provide an enumerated constant for each error
marker mentioned in the grammar, together with text to be printed for each
constant. The order of the constants in this definition determines the order in
which the items are listed in error messages.</p>

<p>The next part of the program consists of some forward declarations relating
to generic parsing support and Unicode category codes, which need to appear in C
before the generated functions. There should be no need to change these.  The
next part of the program is:</p>

<pre>// &lt;pecan
//   comment  = "// %s"
//   declare  = "bool %s(parser *p);"
//   define   = "bool %s(parser *p) { %n return %r; %n}"
//   call     = "%s(p)"
//   act0     = "act(p,0,%s(length(p),start(p)))"
//   act2     = "act(p,2,%s(top(p,1),top(p,0)))"
//   escape1  = "\%3o"
//   escape2  = "\u%4x"
//   escape4  = "\U%8x"
// >

// &lt;/pecan>. End of generated functions.
</pre>

<p>When a grammar is compiled, the generated functions are inserted between the
<code>&lt;pecan></code> and <code>&lt;/pecan></code> tags, in a similar style to
HTML. Any text already present between the tags is deleted. That means compiling
can be repeated as necessary. The two tags are commented out using C comments.
The <code>&lt;pecan></code> tag contains attributes. These define print formats
that are used to generate the parsing functions from the grammar rules.</p>

<p>The attributes shown here establish the C conventions for one-line comments,
forward declarations of functions allowing them to be recursive, definitions of
functions, and calls to functions. The <code>act0</code> and <code>act2</code>
attributes cover the compilation of actions for the calculator, using support
functions <code>length</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>top</code>, and
<code>act</code> to deal with the changes to the parser state such as stack
handling. That allows the hand-written action functions to consist of pure
manipulation of output values. The escape attributes specify how control
characters or Unicode characters appear in the generated functions. Note that
<code>escape1</code> is not defined as <code>\x%2x</code> because in C a
<code>\x</code> escape is variable-length with no terminator, so can be damaged
by a following digit.</p>

<p>Suppose the attributes were changed to:</p>

<pre>
// &lt;pecan
//   comment  = "// %s"
//   declare  = "bool P%s(parser *p);"
//   define   = "bool P%s(parser *p) { %n return %r; %n}"
//   call     = "S%s(p)"
//   id       = "P%s(p)"
//   act0     = "act(p,0,A%s(length(p),start(p)))"
//   act2     = "act(p,2,A%s(top(p,1),top(p,0)))"
//   tag      = "Stag(p,T%s)"
//   mark     = "Smark(p,M%s)"
//   cat      = "Scat(p,C%s)"
//   escape1  = "\%3o"
//   escape2  = "\u%4x"
//   escape4  = "\U%8x"
// >
</pre>

<p>These changes would mean that the names of all generated parsing functions
would be prefixed by <code>P</code>, all support function names by
<code>S</code>, all action function names by <code>A</code>, all tag names by
<code>T</code>, all error marker names by <code>M</code> and all Unicode
category names by <code>C</code>, thus guarding against any possible name clash,
either between the different types of name, or between the names and language
keywords or library functions.</p>

<p>The data files <code>table1.bin</code> and <code>table2.bin</code> can be
used in any programming language to form a two-stage table for looking up the
Unicode category of a character. They are only needed if Unicode categories are
mentioned in the grammar. They currently support Unicode version 12.0, and can
be used in languages with no suitable Unicode support or to make the Unicode
version recognised by the compiled parser independent of the version provided by
the target programming language. The files are used by reading them into byte
arrays in memory, and then looking up the category of an integer character code
<code>ch</code> using one of:</p>

<pre>table2[table1[ch>>8]*256+(ch&amp;255)];
table2[(table1[ch>>8]&amp;255)*256+(ch&amp;255)];
</pre>

<p>The first version is for languages which support unsigned bytes, and the
second is for languages which only support signed bytes. The category
enumeration in the template program defines the categories in alphabetical
order, which is the order used in these tables.</p>
