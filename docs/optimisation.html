<h1>Optimisation</h1>

<p>Pecan currently offers little internal optimisation. Instead, it aims to
provide expressive power so that the parser writer can control efficiency.</p>

<p>An efficiency problem is very often due to overall design or a bottleneck of
some kind. That means it is futile to try to make every detail as efficient as
possible. It is much better to find the design or bottleneck problem, perhaps by
instrumentation, and concentrate effort on solving that.</p>

<p>For example, there often used to be a particular bottleneck in parsers, due
to using a function call to read each character individually from a file, as old
textbooks recommended. In today's world of large computer memories, it is far
more efficient to read the whole file into an array in memory in one go, and
then carry out scanning or parsing on the array. It also makes lookahead and
backtracking far easier.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will look at a few issues which may cause inefficiency,
and how to tackle them.</p>

<h3>Scanners</h3>

<p>A common problem with a combined scanner and parser is that individual
characters of text may be processed too many times. Suppose, for example, there
are rules roughly like this:</p>

<pre>statement = for ... / while ... / if ... / ...
identifier = keyword! letter+
keyword = for / while / if / ...
for = "for" letter!
while = "while" letter!
if = "if" letter!
</pre>

<p>Identifiers and keywords may be used anywhere in the grammar, so they need to
be mutually exclusive. The identifier rule has to exclude keywords. The keyword
rules assume that identifiers such as <code>form</code> are allowed, which have
a keyword as a prefix. So, after matching a keyword string, there needs to be a
check that there are no more letters which turn it into an identifier. This
issue can be seen in the grammar for Pecan itself, where category names are
effectively keywords.</p>

<p>In trying different alternatives in the grammar, the identifier rule and each
of the keyword rules may be tried repeatedly at the same text position.</p>

<p>The efficiency advantage of having a separate scanner is that the scanner can
be written so as to effectively make a single linear pass over the characters.
The parser can then check alternatives by looking at the next token tag rather
than by processing at the character level.</p>

<p>At any one text position, the scanner is looking for a token of any kind. If
keywords are checked before identifiers, then the identifier rule can be
simplified:</p>

<pre>token = keyword / identifier / ...
identifier = letter+
</pre>

<p>The keyword strings themselves can be combined:</p>

<pre>token = keyword / identifier / ...
identifier = letter+
keyword = key letter!
key = "for" / "while" / "if" / ...
</pre>

<p>The keyword rule can be changed to avoid backtracking in the case where it is
recognised but is followed by more letters:</p>

<pre>keyword = key (letter+ @1identifer / @1keyword)
</pre>

<p>Once the keyword strings are together, the implicit linear sequence of tests
can be replaced by a binary search using splitters. The strings are ordered, and
then a splitter placed between the first half and second half:</p>

<pre>key = &lt;df> key1 / key2
key1 = "break" / "case" / "catch" / "continue" / "default"
key2 = "do" / "else" / "for" / "if" / "switch" / "while"
</pre>

<p>Each half of the list can be split again, and so on as many times as
necessary.</p>

<p>Conventional parser generators translate long sequences of alternatives using
switches. Pecan doesn't do this. Instead, splitters allow most of the efficiency
gain to be obtained in a way which can be expressed directly as a
transformation on the grammar that can be applied by the programmer. If greater
efficiency is really needed, keyword recognition can be moved out of the grammar
into the associated code. For example:</p>

<pre>idOrKey = letter+ @1idOrKey
</pre>

<p>The <code>idOrKey</code> action can check whether the word is an identifier
or keyword. Alternatively, if desired, the whole of the scanner can be
hand-crafted, using the Pecan version as a specification.</p>

<h3>Recursive ascent</h3>

<p>Often, a hierarchy of grammar rules is used to specify the precedence and
associativity of operators in a language.  As an example, here is a simple
grammar of arithmetic expressions, including a power operator <code>^</code> to
illustrate right-associativity, and assuming that a separate scanner is used to
ensure that, at the character level, each character is processed only once:</p>

<pre>expression = term (`+` term @2add / `-` term @2subtract)*
term = factor (`*` factor @2multiply / `/` factor @2divide)*
factor = atom (`^` factor @2power)?
atom = `number` @atom / `(` expression `)`
</pre>

<p>For every expression in the source program, the <code>expression</code> rule
is applied, which causes <code>term</code> to be applied, which causes
<code>factor</code> to be applied, which causes <code>atom</code> to be applied,
all before making any progress in the input.</p>

<p>This is not an issue which can easily be solved by an internal optimisation
in a parser generator. One traditional way round the inefficiency is to switch
to a different type of parser, an <a
hjref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser">operator
precedence</a> parser, for the expression part of the grammar.  Another
traditional approach (which works well if the language includes
programmer-defined operators) is to parse expressions without regard to
precedence and associativity, then post-process the resulting parse tree
later.</p>

<p>Another technique, which deserves to be much better known and understood, is
to use a normal recursive descent parser, but to re-work the rules in a
bottom-up fashion.  This is related to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_ascent_parser">recursive
ascent</a> parsing from which the name of this technique has been borrowed, and
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512931">top-down operator
precedence</a> parsing (by Pratt, also described by <a
href="http://crockford.com/javascript/tdop/tdop.html">Crockford</a>).  The
technique will be illustrated by transforming the expression grammar above.</p>

<p>The first step is to split each of the <code>expression</code>,
<code>term</code> and <code>factor</code> rules into two, for convenience:</p>

<pre>expression = term terms
terms = (`+` term @2add / `-` term @2subtract)*
term = factor factors
factors = (`*` factor @2multiply / `/` factor @2divide)*
factor = atom powers
powers = (`^` factor @2power)?
</pre>

<p>Next, substitute the definition of <code>factor</code> into
<code>term</code>, and the resulting definition of <code>term</code> into
<code>expression</code>:</p>

<pre>expression = atom powers factors terms
term = atom powers factors
...
</pre>

<p>Next, split these definitions into two again:</p>

<pre>expression = atom expression2
expression2 = powers factors terms
term = atom term2
term2 = powers factors
...
</pre>

<p>Next, substitute the definition of <code>atom</code> into
<code>expression</code>, <code>term</code> and <code>factor</code>:</p>

<pre>expression = (`number` @atom / `(` expression `)`) expression2
term = (`number` @atom / `(` expression `)`) factor3
factor = (`number` @atom / `(` expression `)`) powers
...
</pre>

<p>Next, distribute the two alternatives of <code>atom</code> in each of the
three rules. The full set of rules at this point is:</p>

<pre>expression = `number` @atom expression2 / `(` expression `)` expression2
terms = (`+` term @2add / `-` term @2subtract)*
expression2 = powers factors terms
term = `number` @atom term2 / `(` expression `)` term2
factors = (`*` factor @2multiply / `/` factor @2divide)*
term2 = powers factors
factor = `number` @atom powers / `(` expression `)` powers
powers = (`^` factor @2power)?
atom = `number` @atom / `(` expression `)`
</pre>

<p>Finally, just for completeness, the definition of <code>powers</code> can be
substituted into the <code>expression2</code> and <code>term2</code> rules:</p>

<pre>expression = `number` @atom expression2 / `(` expression `)` expression2
terms = (`+` term @2add / `-` term @2subtract)*
expression2 = (`^` factor @2power)? factors terms
term = `number` @atom term2 / `(` expression `)` term2
factors = (`*` factor @2multiply / `/` factor @2divide)*
term2 = (`^` factor @2power)? factors
factor = `number` @atom powers / `(` expression `)` powers
powers = (`^` factor @2power)?
atom = `number` @atom / `(` expression `)`
</pre>

<p>Now each of the rules begins more-or-less immediately with the recognition of
its first token. The result of this transformation may or may not be as good as
the best bottom-up parser generators or custom algorithms, but the bulk of the
inefficiency has been eliminated.</p>
