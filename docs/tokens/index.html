<h1>Tokens and trees</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, let's change the calculator example in two ways. First, a
scanner will be defined separately from the parser, so that the parser works
with tokens. Second, the program produced will generate a parse tree from an
arithmetic expression and print it out, rather than calculate its value. The
example will thus be closer to what is needed for practical parsing in larger
scale situations such as compilers for programming languages.</p>

<h3>The scanner</h3>

<p>A scanner for sums can be developed from the full calculator in the previous
tutorial by extracting and adapting the low level rules:</p>

<pre>tokens = gap @array token* end
token = number / plus / minus / times / over / open / close / bad
number = ('0..9')+ @1number gap
plus = '+' @1plus gap
minus = '-' @1minus gap
times = '*' @1times gap
over = '/' @1over gap
open = '(' @1open gap
close = ')' @1close gap
bad = '\r\n'! . @1bad
end = '\r'? '\n' @1end / @1bad
gap = (' ')* @
</pre>

<p>This grammar recognises a sequence of tokens, possibly separated by spaces.
The action <code>@array</code> creates an array, and each of the other actions
creates a token and adds it to the array. The name of each action will be used
as the token's tag. A final sentinel token is added at the end. Although not
strictly necessary, this avoids the need to carry around the array length, and
avoids the need for special cases such as when reporting an error, and marks the
position of the end of the source text to make error messages more accurate.</p>

<p>There are no error markers in the grammar. If an illegal character or lack of
line ending is encountered, a token with tag <code>bad</code> is created for it.
That means the scanner never fails, and errors are passed on to the parser for
reporting. A parse error early on in the text is thus reported in preference to
a scan error later on, creating the illusion for the user that parsing is done
in one pass rather than two. Files containing the grammar and its tests are:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="scan.txt">scan.txt</a><br/>
<a href="scan-test.txt">scan-test.txt</a></p>

<p>The test file begins with a line which specifies the grammar file. Running
the tests through Pecan shows that all is well:</p>

<pre>pecan scan-test.txt
Pass 10 tests.
</pre>

<h3>The parser</h3>

<p>A token-based parser for sums can be developed from the full calculator in
the previous tutorial, replacing the low level rules by tags:</p>

<pre>sum = exp #newline %end
exp = term (#operator %plus term @2add / #operator %minus term @2subtract)*
term = atom (#operator %times atom @2multiply / #operator %over atom @2divide)*
atom = #digit %number @integer / #bracket %open exp #bracket %close
</pre>

<p>The grammar avoids name clashes between actions, tags and markers. When
tokens are recognised, <code>@</code> isn't used to discard them. Instead, the
compiled parser will use the convention that all matched tokens will be ignored
and implicitly discarded by the next action, except that the
<code>@integer</code> action will use the most recently matched token to form a
leaf node. Each of the other actions will form a branch node with two children.
The grammar is stored in a file, and its tests are stored in a separate
file:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="sum.txt">sum.txt</a><br/>
<a href="sum-test.txt">sum-test.txt</a></p>

<p>The tests are checked with Pecan as usual:</p>

<pre>pecan parse-sum-test.txt
Pass 7 tests
</pre>

<h3>Compiling the scanner</h3>

<p>To compile the grammars into a scanner and parser in C, we will again make
use of the provided parser support module:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="parser.h">parser.h</a><br/>
<a href="parser.c">parser.c</a></p>

<p>The scanner can be written as a module like this:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="scan.h">scan.h</a><br/>
<a href="scan.c">scan.c</a></p>

<p>The header defines the token tags and a <code>scan</code> function for the
main program to call. The type for a token structure is provided in
<code>parser.h</code>. The token structure refers to a token's text in the
original source rather than storing a copy, because then tokens have a fixed
size, and error messages can be made in context. An index into the original
text, rather than a pointer, is used for compactness.</p>

<p>The <code>scan</code> function uses the simple object allocation mechanism
provided in the parser module. The tokens form an array which is reallocated as
necessary. The array holds token structures, not pointers to tokens. Token
pointers must not be stored anywhere between actions, because reallocation of
the array invalidates any pointers into it. At the end, <code>getStore</code> is
used to extract the final array.</p>

<p>The parsing functions are compiled from the grammar using print formats:</p>

<pre>//   comment  = "// %s"
//   declare  = "static bool P%s(parser *p);"
//   define   = "static bool P%s(parser *p) { %n return %r; %n}"
//   call     = "%s(p)"
//   id       = "P%s(p)"
//   act0     = "pushR(p,0,%s(p))"
//   act1     = "pushR(p,1,add(p,topR(p,0),%s,start(p),at(p)))"
//   escape1  = "\%3o"
//   escape2  = "\u%4x"
//   escape4  = "\U%8x"
</pre>

<p>The command for compiling the grammar is:</p>

<pre>pecan scan.txt -c scan.c
</pre>

<p>The functions are declared and defined as <code>static</code> to make sure
that their names can't clash with functions defined elsewhere. They are also
defined with prefix <code>P</code> so they don't clash with anything else in the
same module. The <code>@array</code> action pushes the token array on the stack,
and the other actions each add a token to it. In actual fact, the array stored
on the stack isn't really needed, because <code>new</code> allocates each token
in the right place, and the array is extracted at the end using
<code>getStore</code>, but this approach matches the grammar.</p>

<h3>Compiling the parser</h3>

<p>The parser and main program can be written like this:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="sum.c">sum.c</a></p>

<p>This uses the parser module's simple allocation mechanism for nodes. That
means nodes cannot contain pointers to child nodes during parsing, because of
the risk of them being invalidated. One way round this would be to use some
completely different mechanism for allocating nodes in permanent locations, and
use the parser only to hold pointers to them in its stack. However, an
attractive and compact alternative is to use relative references.</p>

<p>In language implementations, a relative reference is often an offset relative
to a base address. That requires the base address to be always available when
needed, e.g. as a global variable. With tree nodes in the parser, it is more
convenient to use node-relative references, where a reference is an offset from
one node to another, and zero can be used for <code>NULL</code> since tree nodes
never need to point to themselves. The parser's allocation mechanism keeps the
nodes contiguous, so <code>int</code> offsets can be used. If these offsets are
in byte units, the nodes can vary in size. However, in <code>sum.c</code>, all
nodes are the same size, so the offset can be in node-size units, which makes
relative addresses particularly simple to use. If <code>p1</code> and
<code>p2</code> are pointers of type <code>node *</code> then a relative
reference from node <code>p1</code> to node <code>p2</code> is simply
<code>p2-p1</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>sum.c</code>, the node type is defined as a union. Effectively, a
node has fields <code>p->tag</code>, <code>p->leaf.number</code>,
<code>p->branch.left</code> and <code>p->branch.right</code> with the leaf field
and branch fields sharing the same space. Nodes are always used with type
<code>node</code>. The types <code>struct leaf</code> and <code>struct
branch</code> are available, but they are only intended for convenience in
initialising a node in one line.</p>

<p>After parsing, <code>getStore</code> is called first, before
<code>topR</code>, because it may cause one last reallocation to reduce the
store to the size of its contents.</p>

<p>The parsing functions are compiled using the print formats:</p>

<pre>//   comment  = "// %s"
//   declare  = "static bool P%s(parser *p);"
//   define   = "static bool P%s(parser *p) { %n return %r; %n}"
//   call     = "%s(p)"
//   id       = "P%s(p)"
//   act0     = "pushR(p,0,act0(p,%s,at(p)))"
//   act2     = "pushR(p,2,act2(p,%s,topR(p,1),topR(p,0)))"
//   escape1  = "\%3o"
//   escape2  = "\u%4x"
//   escape4  = "\U%8x"
</pre>

<p>The command for compiling the grammar, and then compiling the resulting
program with <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>, are:</p>

<pre>pecan sum.txt -c sum.c
gcc -std=c18 -Wall -O3 -flto scan.c sum.c parser.c -o sum
</pre>

<p>The parser module provides a lot of small functions for operating on the
state structure. For effective optimisation, the functions are declared as
<code>extern inline</code> and the <code>-flto</code> option is used. This
switches on cross-module optimization, including inlining, so that there is no
loss in defining the functions in a separate module.</p>
