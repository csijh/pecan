Improvements to syntax:

With tokens, %x or `x` not immediately followed by action is implicitly %x @
(actually works already, but needs stressing).

If a grammar contains %id, then you can use "x" instead of `x` (in fact maybe it
is a good idea to get rid of ``)

Replace:   @startlist (x @2add)* @1endlist
by:        { (x ^)* } @*list

The {} brackets are to be followed immediately by a variable-arg action @*...
    (and an @*... must immediately follow a {...})
The expression inside is stack-checked because of ^, but can generate
    any number of items.
Implemented by pushing a marker on the stack at '{' and doing nothing at ^ and
    using the marker at '}'

Normally, @action cannot be at the beginning of a choice, but an exception can
be made for {. The implementation is:

----------
x y / x z ==? x (y / z)

What if x succeeds and y soft-fails?

'a' 'b' / 'a' 'c'   ==?   'a' ('b' / 'c')
input ac

----------
Let's try again to use || for OR and && for AND.
A parser function p succeeds, or fails (consuming input), or mismatches.
A parse function must return 'true' if it fails so that p || q works.
But it must return 'false' if it fails so that p && q works.
So, we need some kind of exception mechanism for lookahead.
