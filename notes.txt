TODO:
+ literal names (node.name()) and camels for hyphens
+ edge cases in in/out for tests (escapes?)
+ transformer - redo Checker
+ transformer - what about source?
+ escape 124
+ %s versus %l for declare/define, and how adapt id names.
+ in compiler, two more warnings (see checker)
- in compiler, 'or' versus 'and' when go()&&... (too many brackets?)

- extend the calculator tutorial to include bytecode generation.
- extend the manual to include a discussion of the C interpreter.

- is there a lift optimisation for markers?
- analyse NEED properly

Improvements to bytecode interpreter
------------------------------------
Pre-compute failure sets. Add switch. Allow grammars without
actions to be interpreted, using implicit variable arguments.  Check for
tail-call optimizations.
