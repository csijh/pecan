TODO:
+ BOM
+ full set of escapes
+ literal names (node.name()) and camels for hyphens
- edge cases in in/out for tests (escapes?)
- in compiler, 'or' versus 'and' when go()&&... (too many brackets?)
- is there a lift optimisation for markers?
- analyse NEED properly
- transformer - redo Checker
- transformer - what about source?

- extend the calculator tutorial to include bytecode generation.
- extend the manual to include a discussion of the C interpreter.

Improvements to bytecode interpreter
------------------------------------
Pre-compute failure sets. Add switch. Allow grammars without
actions to be interpreted, using implicit variable arguments.  Check for
tail-call optimizations.
